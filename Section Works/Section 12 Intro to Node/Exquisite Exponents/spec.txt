Add a new GET endpoint, /math/power/:base/:exponent. It should then respond in 
JSON with the result of putting the base to the exponent power.
{"result": 16}
After that, implement a fetch request on the client-side to send the values in 
#base-in and #exponent-in and print the result to #power-result.
