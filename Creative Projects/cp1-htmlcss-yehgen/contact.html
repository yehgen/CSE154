        If there are any questions, feel free to reach out to me!

      <p>
        I will be glad to talk about my journey with
        <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/">HCDE</a> and discuss my initial application.
        <br> I was directly admitted into the College of Engineering through the Direct to College
        process, however, so I can only speak about my own experiences and will not be able
        speak about the regular admissions process. I can however, discuss my writing and ideas
        for the essay(s) and prompts given for the regular cycle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, if there are any questions about classes I have taken, I will be glad
        to share my input and ratings of individual classes. I will attempt to give an unbiased
        opinion of the class overviewing the applications, but will also share how the structure
        was or was not effective in my learning.
