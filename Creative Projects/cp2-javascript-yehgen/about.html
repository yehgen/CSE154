    <h1>Hi, here's a little more about myself</h1>
    <section class="content">
      <p>
        My first coding experience was CSE142 in the autumn quarter of my freshman year at the
        University of Washington, so I started with minimal coding knowledge. For those who may
        think coding is challenging (including myself), just know that it is likely just as hard
        for others, but also fun and exciting!
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides classes and coding, I'm also associated with a few student organizations on
        campus. I am always looking for more ways to meet people and to get involved within the
        community, but time conflicts are an issue. The top 3 I'm most involved with are
        listed below:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Husky Wrestling
          <ul>
            <li>Tuesdays from 8:30 - 10:30 PM</li>
            <li>Thursdays from 8:30 - 10:30 PM</li>
            <li>Sundays from 2:00 - 4:00 PM</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Acts 2 Fellowship
          <ul>
            <li>Tuesdays from 7:00 - 10:00 PM</li>
            <li>Fridays vary</li>
            <li>Sundays from 1:00 - 2:30 PM</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Asian-American InterVarsity
          <ul>
            <li>Tuesdays from 7:00 - 9:00 PM</li>
            <li>Thursdays from 7:00 - 9:00 PM</li>
            <li>Fridays vary</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As seen, a lot of organizations and clubs meeting times overlap, so I'd love to hear
        about other clubs that meet on other days. Below, you can take notes on personal clubs
        and consider the times. Then you can compare them to my clubs to see if you're interested
        or even recommend me some of your own!
