        I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Washington studying Human Centered Design
        and Engineering (HCDE). Within this field, I am branching into the Human-Computer
        Interaction tract and applying my knowledge to UX design.

            <h3>Hack Washington: January 12th, 2019</h3>
            This was my first hackathon and I went in knowing only basic Java. I was only able to
            complete CSE142: Computer Programming I and my friends encouraged me to just apply. Hack
            Washington was hosted at the Space Needle, which was unique, and offered me my first
            experience to code with a team, under time constraints, and work with different skill
            levels, knowledge, and experience. Here, we created an application that read an input
            text and used Google's Natural Language API to list out characteristics of the given
            words.

            <h3>DubHacks 2019: October 12th, 2019</h3>
            I went into DubHacks with both the introductory Computer Programming courses for Java
            (CSE142 and CSE143) under my belt and a little bit of self taught HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. Using the React framework for JavaScript, we designed a web application
            intended to help users build habits based on the notion that it takes approximately
            66 days of consistently performing a task to transform the given task into a habit. We
            learned React as we went along, with minimal prior knowledge.
